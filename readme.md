# Advent of Code 2024

I decided to do this year's Advent of Code in Rust. I swear I'll complete it all this year!

# Structure

The code for each day has been split into its own file within the `days/` directory and the corresponding input files have been put in `inputs/`. 

```
src/
    main.rs
    days/
        day01.rs
        day02.rs
        ...
    inputs/
        day01.txt
        day01_test.txt
        ...
```
# Running

I'm running each day's solution with `cargo run <day>`. For example:
```bash
$ cargo run 1
Day 01
Part 1: 1234
Part 2: 1235
```

# Testing

I'm creating test cases based on each day's example. You can run the tests with `cargo test`.
