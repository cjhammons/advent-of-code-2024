# Advent of Code 2024

I decided to do this year's Advent of Code in Rust. I swear I'll complete it all this year!

# Testing

I'm creating test cases based on each day's example. You can run the tests with `cargo test`.

# Running

I'm running each day's solution with `cargo run <day>`. For example:
```bash
$ cargo run 1
Day 01
Part 1: 1234
Part 2: 1235
```
